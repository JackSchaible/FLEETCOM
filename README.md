FLEETCOM
==============

FLEETCOM is a game I've wanted to make for awhile. It's based on a doodle I made in high school where I drew a bunch of starships from various sci fi series I was watching/playing at the time fighting each other. Since then, I've wanted to actually make this a game. I figure I can avoid any copyright conflicts by not directly mentioning any names and drawing all the assets myself, maybe making a few changes.
